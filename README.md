    <h2>About me</h2>
    <p>I started learning programming at the beginning of 2021. At first it was like a hobby for me. I liked the feeling that I could solve the problems associated with development, and I decided that I wanted to do it professionally. After a while, I found the Rolling Scopes school and enrolled in the following courses.
I liked the curriculum, the big community and the fact that the students help each other. Now I continue to study at RS School and am open to job offers.</p>

  This is the latest team project that we are very proud of!

  The purpose of this task was:
  1. Divide into teams of 3.
  2. Find an idea to implement.
  3. Implement the project.

  Three weeks were allocated for the implementation of the project. 

  Our project was a full-service photo agency, with a landing page to attract clients and a CRM-system for internal and external interaction.

  The following technologies were used in the project: 
  Typescript, Javascript, 
  Node JS,
  Express JS, 
  MongoDB/Mongoose,
  Webpack, Babel, Eslint.

  I have made personal contributions to: 
  1. Developed the future architecture and logic of the application together with my colleagues.
  2. Implemented server operation and interaction with the database (authorization, registration, authentication, sending e-mail notifications, order storage and interaction with them, user storage and interaction with them).
  3. Created components for easy creation of application elements.
  4. Using the written components, I implemented the following parts of the application:
  - Menu section.
  - Section for creating a new order
  - The section for viewing, creating, editing and deleting users
  - The statistics section (the Chart JS library was used)
  5. Styling the entire application.

Links lead to Pull Request, where you can find a detailed description of the implemented features, as well as the necessary accesses to work with the application.
