    <h2>About me</h2>
    <p>I started learning programming at the beginning of 2021. At first it was like a hobby for me. I liked the feeling that I could solve the problems associated with development, and I decided that I wanted to do it professionally. After a while, I found the Rolling Scopes school and enrolled in the following courses.
I liked the curriculum, the big community and the fact that the students help each other. Now I continue to study at RS School and am open to job offers.</p>

Two-page site, with adaptive-flexible layout for any screen extension.
Implemented:
a burger menu for screens smaller than 768px, an infinite slider with animal cards, a pop-up with information about the animal when you click on the card, and pagination is implemented on the "our pets" page. Also in this project for the first time I used the Sass preprocessor and the BEM methodology.</td>

In this project, I first used:
Webpack, ESlint, Babel.
The HTML page is created dynamically, there are two ways to change the language, the keyboard works the same way when you click on the physical keyboard, and when you click on the virtual one.
Implemented modifier keys - Shift, CapsLock and CRTL & ALT key combination.</td>
