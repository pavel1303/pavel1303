    <h2>About me</h2>
    <p>I started learning programming at the beginning of 2021. At first it was like a hobby for me. I liked the feeling that I could solve the problems associated with development, and I decided that I wanted to do it professionally. After a while, I found the Rolling Scopes school and enrolled in the following courses.
I liked the curriculum, the big community and the fact that the students help each other. Now I continue to study at RS School and am open to job offers.</p>

Implemented:
a burger menu for screens smaller than 768px, an infinite slider with animal cards, a pop-up with information about the animal when you click on the card, and pagination is implemented on the "our pets" page. Also in this project for the first time I used the Sass preprocessor and the BEM methodology.</td>

Implemented modifier keys - Shift, CapsLock and CRTL & ALT key combination.</td>
